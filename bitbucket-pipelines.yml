# bitbucket-pipelines.yml
# This is a basic CI/CD pipeline configuration for Bitbucket Pipelines.
# It defines steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

# You can use a Docker image for your build environment.
# Here, we're using a Python image.
image: python:3.9.18-slim-bullseye

# Define the pipeline steps.
pipelines:
  default: # This pipeline runs on every push to any branch
    - step:
        name: Install Dependencies
        caches:
          - pip # Cache pip dependencies to speed up builds
        script:
          - pip install pipenv # Or pip install -r requirements.txt if not using pipenv
          - pipenv install --dev --skip-lock # Install dependencies from Pipfile.lock
          # If you are using requirements.txt directly, uncomment the line below:
          # - pip install -r requirements.txt
        artifacts:
          - "**/*" # Keep all files for subsequent steps

    - step:
        name: Run Tests
        script:
          - pipenv run pytest # Run your tests (assuming pytest is installed and configured)
          # Add any other test commands here, e.g., linting, static analysis
          # - pipenv run flake8 .
          # - pipenv run mypy .

    - step:
        name: Build and Package (Optional)
        # This step is for building artifacts if your project requires it (e.g., frontend build)
        # For a simple Python app, this might not be strictly necessary.
        script:
          - echo "Building application artifacts..."
          # Add commands to build your application, e.g.,
          # - npm install
          # - npm run build
        artifacts:
          - "build/**" # Example: collect build output

  branches:
    main: # This pipeline runs only on pushes to the 'main' branch
      - step:
          name: Install Dependencies (Main Branch)
          caches:
            - pip
          script:
            - pip install pipenv
            - pipenv install --dev --skip-lock
          artifacts:
            - "**/*"

      - step:
          name: Run Tests (Main Branch)
          script:
            - pipenv run pytest

      - step:
          name: Deploy to Production
          deployment: production # Mark this step as a production deployment
          trigger: manual # This step will require manual approval to run
          script:
            - echo "Deploying to production environment..."
            # Add your deployment commands here. This will vary greatly based on your hosting.
            # Examples:
            # - rsync -avz . user@your-server:/var/www/html
            # - aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name
            # - docker build -t your-app .
            # - docker push your-registry/your-app:latest
            # - kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
            - echo "Deployment complete!"
